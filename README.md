Hello!

This is a simple C++ project created in my Computer Science 1 course taken the Spring of 2024. 
The goal of this project is to display a menu to the user with options of display city data, sorting city data, finding the distance between two cities and more.
This was done by reading in multiple .txt files (location and cityNames) in order to match latitude and longitude coordinates to city names using their respective ID numbers. 
This is a fairly straightforward project without using the string library due to classwork requirements.
